## Generating PDF Documents

The `.md` files are processed into `.pdf` files using VS Code and it's extension [Markdown PDF](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzane.markdown-pdf). To generate a .pdf file, right-click on .md file's contents and select "Markdown PDF: Export (pdf)".

Before uploading (or other use), the .pdf files are manually renamed using a naming convention `ddmmyyyy-filename-locale.pdf`, where `ddmmyyyy` represents the published date, `locale` represents language-country identifier (e.g. `de-ch`), and `filename` is the original .md file's name. Note that the date is typically mentioned in the document contents as well.
