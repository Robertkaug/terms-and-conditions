# Augment Terms and Conditions

This repository contains customer facing terms and conditions documents in markdown format.

The `.md` files are processed into `.pdf` files using VS Code and it's extension [Markdown PDF](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzane.markdown-pdf). To generate a .pdf file, right-click on .md file's contents and select "Markdown PDF: Export (pdf)".

Before uploading (or other use), the .pdf files are manually renamed using a naming convention `ddmmyyyy-filename.pdf`, where `ddmmyyyy` represents the published date and `filename` is the original .md file's name. Note that the date is typically mentioned in the document contents as well.
